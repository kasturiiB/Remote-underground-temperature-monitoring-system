# Remote underground temperature monitoring system
Overview
<br> <br>
 A solar-powered, remote temperature monitoring system that can measure and log underground and near-surface environmental conditions in real-time is designed and built.
The Remote underground temperature monitoring system is designed for continuous, real-time environmental data collection in remote locations. It supports multiple sensors and timestamped logging, enabling precise analysis of underground and surface temperatures.
<br>
Built for durability and scalability, the system is solar-powered, making it ideal for unattended deployments. <br> <br> <br> <br>
Why Choose the Remote Underground Temperature Monitoring System? <br>
This project facilitates accurate, timestamped temperature monitoring in challenging environments. Key features include:

 - Multi-Sensor Support: Collects data from DHT22 and DS18B20 sensors to provide comprehensive environmental insights.

 - Timestamped Logging: Utilizes RTC modules to ensure precise and synchronized data records.

 - Solar-Powered: Optimized for remote, off-grid deployments with reliable, sustainable energy.

 - Continuous Monitoring: Enables real-time data collection for ongoing analysis, control, and environmental management.
